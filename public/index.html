            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>This is a website to poll public opinions of ratings for the 50 US States.  Here, you can create
               a personal rating map.  You can submit the map to a central server, where at the end the average rating
               for each state will be compiled together into an overall rating map.</p>
            <h2>Why isn't DC included in the counter for remaining states?</h2>
            <p>DC is not a state.  You can rate it all you want, but it will not be included in the final submission.</p>
            <h2>Who are you?</h2>
            <p>Just a hero for fun</p>
            <h2>This is pretty cool</h2>
            <p>Ok</p>
            <h2>I want to give you money.</h2>
            <p>I refuse. Go donate it to some charity or something instead.</p>
            <h2>I want to hire you / start a company with you.</h2>
