# RateTheStates
A small web application that allows for users to use a map to rate all 50 states on some subjective basis.

The application displays a map of all 50 US states, and allows the user to "paint" the map using colors that represent
the numbers 1 to 10.  Once the user has completed the map, they can submit it to the server.  The server stores a list
of all user ratings of the states, and at the end generates a map of the average ratings for each state.

This application can be used to poll opinions regarding any topic that is divisive among states.  For example, which
states have the best and worst food?  Which states are the best for outdoor activities?  The server administrator can
change the question to get different maps of public internet opinion.
